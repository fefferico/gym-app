*   **Linear & Cycled Programs**:
    *   **Linear**: Design a program with a specific, unique schedule for each week (e.g., a 12-week powerlifting program).
    *   **Cycled**: Create a repeating schedule that is not tied to a standard week (e.g., an Upper/Lower split that repeats every 4 days).
*   **Calendar View**: Visualize your active program's schedule on a weekly or monthly calendar, showing which routines are planned for which days.
*   **Program Activation**: Set a program as "active" to have it appear on your dashboard. You can have multiple active programs.

### History & Statistics

*   **Unified History**: A single, filterable list and calendar view that combines all your logged workouts and activities in chronological order.
*   **Statistics Dashboard**:
    *   **Key Metrics**: View your total workout count, total volume lifted, current streak, and longest streak.
    *   **Charts**: Visualize your progress with charts for volume distributed by muscle group and your total weekly volume over time.
    *   **Data Tables**: See detailed weekly summaries and a performance breakdown by muscle group.
*   **Personal Bests (PBs)**: The app automatically tracks your personal bests for each exercise, including:
    *   1, 3, and 5 Rep Max (both actual and estimated).
    *   Heaviest weight lifted for any number of reps.
    *   Max reps for bodyweight exercises.
    *   Max duration for timed holds.

### Profile & Settings

*   **User Profile**: Store your username, gender, and a history of your body measurements (weight, height, chest, waist, etc.).
*   **Measurement History**: Track your body measurements over time and view your progress in a chart. You can also upload and compare progress photos.
*   **App Settings**:
    *   **Units**: Choose between kilograms (kg) and pounds (lbs).
    *   **Theme**: Switch between a light and dark mode.
    *   **Workout Player**: Customize the behavior of the workout player, such as enabling countdown sounds or pre-set timers.
    *   **Progressive Overload**: Configure automatic suggestions for increasing weight or reps based on your past performance to ensure continuous progress.

## What You Can Do

*   Log any physical activity with detailed metrics.
*   Create, customize, and follow structured workout routines and long-term training programs.
*   Track your performance in real-time with a workout player.
*   Analyze your progress with a detailed history and visual statistics.
*   Add and manage your own custom exercises.
*   Track your body measurements and progress photos.
*   Backup and restore all your application data.

## What You Can't Do (Current Limitations)

*   **No Cloud Sync or User Accounts**: All data is stored locally in your web browser's storage. This means clearing your browser data will erase your application data. There are no user accounts or automatic cloud backups.
*   **No Social Features**: The application is designed for individual use and does not include features for sharing workouts or progress with other users.
*   **No Real-time Form Correction**: The "Kettlebell Workout Tracker" feature with pose detection is an experimental work-in-progress and is not integrated into the main workout logging flow.

## Getting Started

1.  **Set up your Profile**: Navigate to "Profile & Settings" to enter your username, measurements, and preferred units (kg/lbs).
2.  **Explore the Exercise Library**: Familiarize yourself with the available exercises.
3.  **Create a Routine**: Go to "My Routines" and build your first workout plan.
4.  **Start a Program (Optional)**: If you have a long-term plan, create a Training Program and schedule your routines.
5.  **Start Tracking**: Go to the home screen and start your first scheduled workout, or pick any routine to start an ad-hoc session.

## Data Management

**It is highly recommended to export your data regularly as a backup.** Since all data is stored in your browser, it can be lost if you clear your browser cache or use a different device.

*   **Export**: Go to `Profile & Settings -> Data Management -> Export Data`. A JSON file containing all your data will be downloaded.
*   **Import**: Go to `Profile & Settings -> Data Management` and select the JSON backup file to restore or merge your data.
